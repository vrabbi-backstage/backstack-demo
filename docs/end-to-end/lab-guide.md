# End To End BACKStack Demo

In this guide we will go through a hands on walkthrough of the demo environment, and what the day to day experience is like in a Platform built off of the BACKStack.

# Setup the environment
Before starting the walkthrough, make sure you have setup the environment based on the relevant README for your environment:
* For GitHub Codespaces using the Web IDE follow [these instructions](.devcontainer/WEB_BASED_CODESPACE.md)
* For GitHub Codespaces using a Desktop VSCode environment follow [these instructions](.devcontainer/DESKTOP_BASED_CODESPACE.md)
* For a local setup on your own machine follow [these instructions](./MANUAL_SETUP.md)
# Exploring around the environment
<details>
  <summary>Explore What is installed in the environment</summary>
Let's see what is currently deployed in our environment by running a few helm and kubectl commands:

# Explore What Is Installed
## Lets see what helm charts are installed
  
```bash
helm ls -A
```

As we can see we have a few Helm charts deployed in the environment:
1. Crossplane
2. Backstage
3. Kyverno

## Lets see what else we have installed
We also have some Applications installed via YAML manifests and not through helm:
  
1. ArgoCD
```bash
kubectl get all -n argocd
```
  
2. Cert Manager
```bash
kubectl get all -n cert-manager
```
  
3. Ingress NGINX
```bash
kubectl get all -n ingress-nginx
```

4. Metrics Server
```bash
kubectl get all -n kube-system  -l k8s-app=metrics-server
```

## Component Configurations Applied
We also have preconfigured in the environment some configurations for the environment. Let's explore what we have deployed for each of the components of the BACKStack.
  
  
<details>
  <summary>Backstage</summary>
  
For Backstage, all of the configurations have been applied within the Backstage container image used in this lab with the needed plugins installed, as well as there configuration, which is applied as a secret via the Helm Chart installed during the setup phase.
  
<details>
  <summary>Included Plugins</summary>
Let's go over a quick overview of these plugins and see what they provide and how we installed then.

### Kubernetes Ingestor 
Automatically create catalog entities from Kubernetes resources, with support for custom GVKs, Crossplane claims, and KRO resources. It also create GitOps friendly Software Templates for Crossplane Claims/Composites, CRDs, and KRO Instances.

  <summary>Backstage Configuration</summary>
Let's take a look at the Configuration of the Backstage app in this environment:

### Configuration Structure

The application configuration is organized into several key sections, each controlling different aspects of the Backstage instance:

#### App Configuration

```yaml
app:
  title: Backstack Kubecon 2025 NA Demo
  baseUrl: http://localhost:3000
  packages: all
```

The app section defines the basic application settings:
- **title**: Display name for the Backstage instance
- **baseUrl**: The frontend application URL
- **packages**: Set to `all` to enable all packages by default from `packages/app/package.json`

##### Extension Configuration

The configuration customizes the UI by:
- Disabling default nav items (search, user-settings, catalog, scaffolder) as they're manually rendered in `packages/app/src/modules/nav/Sidebar.tsx`
- Disabling default entity cards (has-subcomponents, depends-on-components, depends-on-resources)
- Configuring the catalog index page to be the root path (`/`) instead of the default `/catalog`

##### Organization

```yaml
organization:
  name: Backstack
```

Defines the organization name that appears throughout the interface.

#### Backend Configuration

The backend section is the most comprehensive part of the configuration:

##### Authentication

```yaml
backend:
  auth:
    externalAccess:
      - type: static
        options:
          token: k9lPknGFOGEiHSVuxo1PxKZ+8EfKXBkz
          subject: mcp-clients
```

Configures static token authentication for external access, particularly for MCP clients. The token allows authorized clients to interact with the backend APIs without going through the standard OAuth flow.

##### Actions Registry

```yaml
backend:
  actions:
    pluginSources:
      - 'catalog'
      - 'crossplane'
      - 'kyverno'
```

Registers action sources from specific plugins, enabling those plugins to provide scaffolder actions and MCP tools.

##### Network Configuration

```yaml
backend:
  baseUrl: http://localhost:7007
  listen:
    port: 7007
  cors:
    origin: http://localhost:3000
    methods: [GET, HEAD, PATCH, POST, PUT, DELETE]
    credentials: true
```

Configures the backend server networking:
- **baseUrl**: Backend API endpoint
- **listen.port**: Port the backend listens on
- **cors**: Cross-Origin Resource Sharing settings for frontend-backend communication

##### Database

```yaml
backend:
  database:
    client: better-sqlite3
    connection: ':memory:'
```

Uses an in-memory SQLite database for development purposes. For production deployments, this should be replaced with a persistent database like PostgreSQL.

##### Security

```yaml
backend:
  csp:
    connect-src: ["'self'", 'http:', 'https:']
```

Content Security Policy configuration to control allowed connection sources.

##### Reading Configuration

```yaml
backend:
  reading:
    allow:
      - host: raw.githubusercontent.com
```

Configures which external hosts can be accessed when reading remote content, particularly for catalog entity definitions.

#### Integrations

```yaml
integrations:
  github:
    - host: github.com
      token: ${GITHUB_TOKEN}
```

Configures GitHub integration using an environment variable for the access token. This enables:
- Reading catalog entities from GitHub repositories
- Publishing scaffolder outputs to GitHub
- GitHub authentication

#### TechDocs

```yaml
techdocs:
  builder: 'local'
  generator:
    runIn: 'docker'
  publisher:
    type: 'local'
```

Configures the TechDocs feature for documentation generation:
- **builder**: Uses local building (alternative: external)
- **generator.runIn**: Runs the documentation generator in Docker containers
- **publisher.type**: Publishes documentation locally (alternatives: googleGcs, awsS3)

#### Authentication Providers

```yaml
auth:
  experimentalDynamicClientRegistration:
    enabled: true
  providers:
    guest: {}
    github:
      development:
        clientId: ${GITHUB_CLIENT_ID}
        clientSecret: ${GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET}
        signIn:
          resolvers:
            - resolver: usernameMatchingUserEntityName
```

Configures authentication providers:
- **experimentalDynamicClientRegistration**: Enables OAuth2 dynamic client registration for MCP clients
- **guest**: Allows guest access without authentication
- **github**: GitHub OAuth authentication with username-based user entity resolution

#### Software Catalog

```yaml
catalog:
  import:
    entityFilename: catalog-info.yaml
    pullRequestBranchName: backstage-integration
  rules:
    - allow: [Component, System, API, Resource, Location]
```

The catalog configuration defines:
- **import**: Settings for importing entities via the Backstage web UI
- **rules**: Allowed entity kinds in the catalog

##### Catalog Locations

The configuration includes several catalog entity sources:
- **Local file entities**: `../../examples/entities.yaml` and `../../examples/org.yaml`
- **Local templates**: `../../examples/template/template.yaml`
- **Remote templates**: GitHub-hosted Terraform module template
- **Remote components**: GitHub-hosted component with AI rules

#### Permissions

```yaml
permission:
  enabled: false
```

Permissions system is currently disabled, allowing unrestricted access to all resources.

#### Kubernetes Ingestor

```yaml
kubernetesIngestor:
  mappings:
    namespaceModel: 'default'
    nameModel: 'name'
    titleModel: 'name'
    systemModel: 'namespace'
    referencesNamespaceModel: 'default'
```

The Kubernetes Ingestor plugin configuration controls how Kubernetes resources are ingested as catalog entities:

##### Component Ingestion

```yaml
kubernetesIngestor:
  components:
    enabled: true
    taskRunner:
      frequency: 10
      timeout: 600
    excludedNamespaces:
      - kube-public
      - kube-system
    customWorkloadTypes: []
    disableDefaultWorkloadTypes: true
    onlyIngestAnnotatedResources: false
```

Settings for ingesting Kubernetes workloads as components:
- **enabled**: Turns on component ingestion
- **taskRunner**: Runs ingestion every 10 seconds with a 10-minute timeout
- **excludedNamespaces**: System namespaces to skip
- **onlyIngestAnnotatedResources**: When false, ingests all resources (not just annotated ones)

##### Crossplane Integration

```yaml
kubernetesIngestor:
  crossplane:
    claims:
      ingestAllClaims: true
    xrds:
      convertDefaultValuesToPlaceholders: true
      enabled: true
      publishPhase:
        allowRepoSelection: false
        allowedTargets: ['github.com']
        target: github
        git:
          repoUrl: github.com?owner=${GITHUB_OWNER}&repo=${GITHUB_REPO}
          targetBranch: main
      taskRunner:
        frequency: 10
        timeout: 600
      ingestAllXRDs: true
```

Crossplane-specific ingestion settings:
- **claims.ingestAllClaims**: Automatically ingests all Crossplane claims
- **xrds**: Configuration for Crossplane XRD (Composite Resource Definition) ingestion and template generation
- **publishPhase**: Settings for publishing generated templates to GitHub

#### Crossplane Plugin

```yaml
crossplane:
  enablePermissions: false
```

Disables the Crossplane permission framework, allowing unrestricted access to Crossplane resources.

#### Kyverno Plugin

```yaml
kyverno:
  enablePermissions: false
```

Disables the Kyverno permission framework, allowing unrestricted access to policy reports.

#### Kubernetes Plugin

```yaml
kubernetes:
  frontend:
    podDelete:
      enabled: true
  serviceLocatorMethod:
    type: 'singleTenant'
  clusterLocatorMethods:
    - type: 'config'
      clusters:
        - name: demo-cluster
          authProvider: 'serviceAccount'
          skipTLSVerify: true
          url: ${KUBERNETES_URL}
          serviceAccountToken: ${KUBERNETES_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_TOKEN}
```

Configures Kubernetes integration:
- **frontend.podDelete**: Enables pod deletion from the UI
- **serviceLocatorMethod**: Uses single-tenant mode (all components use the same cluster)
- **clusterLocatorMethods**: Defines cluster connection using service account authentication

### Environment Variables

The configuration references several environment variables that must be set:

- `GITHUB_TOKEN`: GitHub personal access token for API access
- `GITHUB_CLIENT_ID`: OAuth app client ID for GitHub authentication
- `GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET`: OAuth app client secret for GitHub authentication
- `GITHUB_OWNER`: GitHub organization/user for Crossplane template publishing
- `GITHUB_REPO`: GitHub repository for Crossplane template publishing
- `KUBERNETES_URL`: Kubernetes cluster API server URL
- `KUBERNETES_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_TOKEN`: Service account token for Kubernetes access

### Best Practices

1. **Never commit secrets**: Use environment variables for all sensitive data
2. **Use persistent database**: Replace in-memory database with PostgreSQL for production
3. **Enable permissions**: Once deployed, enable the permissions system for security
4. **Configure TLS**: Update URLs to use HTTPS in production
5. **Restrict CORS**: Limit CORS origins to specific domains in production
6. **Review proxy endpoints**: Ensure proxy endpoints are necessary and secure
7. **Rotate tokens**: Regularly rotate all authentication tokens
8. **Enable monitoring**: Add observability configuration for production deployments

  <summary>ArgoCD</summary>
In the demo app we have setup ArgoCD with an ApplicationSet which is used to sync resources to the Kubernetes Cluster from our Git Repo.

### ApplicationSet Configuration

The demo environment uses a Git file-based ApplicationSet generator to automatically create ArgoCD Applications based on the repository structure:

```yaml
apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1
kind: ApplicationSet
metadata:
  name: demo-cluster-files
  namespace: argocd
spec:
  goTemplate: true
  goTemplateOptions: ["missingkey=error"]
  generators:
    - git:
        repoURL: https://github.com/${GITHUB_OWNER}/${GITHUB_REPO}.git
        revision: main
        files:
          - path: demo-cluster/*/*/*.yaml
```

#### How it Works

The ApplicationSet uses a **Git file generator** with the following pattern: `demo-cluster/*/*/*.yaml`

This means it will discover any YAML file following the structure:
- `demo-cluster/<namespace>/<kind>/<filename>.yaml`

For example:
- `demo-cluster/default/App/my-app.yaml` → Creates an ArgoCD Application named `default-app-my-app`
- `demo-cluster/production/WebApp/frontend.yaml` → Creates an ArgoCD Application named `production-webapp-frontend`

#### Application Template

Each discovered file generates an ArgoCD Application with:

**Naming Convention:**
```
<namespace>-<kind>-<filename>
```
All converted to lowercase.

**Sync Policy:**
- **Automated**: Applications sync automatically when changes are detected
- **Prune**: Resources removed from Git are deleted from the cluster
- **SelfHeal**: Manual changes to resources are reverted to match Git
- **CreateNamespace**: Namespaces are created automatically if they don't exist

**Destination:**
- **Server**: `https://kubernetes.default.svc` (the local cluster)
- **Namespace**: Extracted from the directory structure (index.path.segments[1])

#### Benefits

1. **GitOps Native**: All resources in the `demo-cluster/` directory are automatically synced
2. **Self-Service**: Developers can create new applications by simply adding files to the repository
3. **Organized Structure**: Clear directory structure based on namespace and resource kind
4. **Automated Sync**: Changes to Git are automatically applied to the cluster
5. **Self-Healing**: Manual changes are automatically reverted to maintain Git as source of truth

#### Usage Example

To deploy a new Crossplane Claim through ArgoCD:

1. Create the directory structure: `demo-cluster/default/WebApp/`
2. Add your claim YAML: `demo-cluster/default/WebApp/my-webapp.yaml`
3. Commit and push to the `main` branch
4. ArgoCD automatically creates an Application named `default-webapp-my-webapp`
5. The WebApp claim is synced to the `default` namespace

You can view all auto-generated Applications with:

```bash
kubectl get applications -n argocd
```

And monitor their sync status with:

```bash
kubectl get applications -n argocd -o wide
```
</details>
<details>
  <summary>Crossplane</summary>

In the demo environment, Crossplane is configured as the platform abstraction layer that allows developers to provision infrastructure and application resources using Kubernetes-style APIs. The configuration includes functions, providers, XRDs (Composite Resource Definitions), and compositions.

### Crossplane Components

The Crossplane setup is organized into several directories:

#### 1. Functions (`01-functions/`)

Crossplane Functions enable pipeline-style composition with advanced templating capabilities:

**Go Templating Function:**
```yaml
apiVersion: pkg.crossplane.io/v1
kind: Function
metadata:
  name: crossplane-contrib-function-go-templating
spec:
  package: xpkg.crossplane.io/crossplane-contrib/function-go-templating:v0.11.0
```
Enables Go template-based resource generation in compositions.

**KCL Function:**
```yaml
apiVersion: pkg.crossplane.io/v1
kind: Function
metadata:
  name: crossplane-contrib-function-kcl
spec:
  package: xpkg.crossplane.io/crossplane-contrib/function-kcl:v0.11.5
```
Enables KCL (kcl-lang.io) for complex logic in compositions.

**Additional Functions:**
- **Patch & Transform Function**: For standard patching and transformation operations
- **Pythonic Function**: For Python-based composition logic

#### 2. Providers (`02-providers/`)

**Provider Kubernetes:**
```yaml
apiVersion: pkg.crossplane.io/v1
kind: Provider
metadata:
  name: crossplane-contrib-provider-kubernetes
spec:
  package: xpkg.crossplane.io/crossplane-contrib/provider-kubernetes:v1.0.0
  runtimeConfigRef:
    apiVersion: pkg.crossplane.io/v1beta1
    kind: DeploymentRuntimeConfig
    name: provider-kubernetes
```

This provider allows Crossplane to create and manage native Kubernetes resources, enabling:
- Creation of Deployments, Services, ConfigMaps, Secrets, etc.
- Full lifecycle management of Kubernetes resources
- Cross-namespace and cross-cluster resource provisioning

#### 3. Provider Configs (`03-provider-configs/`)

Provider configurations define how providers authenticate and connect to target systems. In this demo, the provider-kubernetes is configured to manage resources in the local cluster.

#### 4. XRDs - Composite Resource Definitions (`04-xrds/`)

The demo includes three platform APIs defined as XRDs:

**App (Namespaced):**
```yaml
apiVersion: apiextensions.crossplane.io/v2
kind: CompositeResourceDefinition
metadata:
  name: apps.example.crossplane.io
spec:
  scope: Namespaced
  group: example.crossplane.io
  names:
    kind: App
    plural: apps
```

A simple application abstraction that:
- Takes a container `image` as input
- Creates a Kubernetes Deployment and Service
- Exposes `replicas` and `address` in status

**ClusterApp (Cluster-Scoped):**
```yaml
apiVersion: apiextensions.crossplane.io/v2
kind: CompositeResourceDefinition
metadata:
  name: clusterapps.example.clustered.crossplane.io
spec:
  scope: Cluster
  group: example.clustered.crossplane.io
  names:
    kind: ClusterApp
    plural: clusterapps
```

Similar to App but cluster-scoped, allowing:
- Cross-namespace deployments
- Specification of target `namespace`
- Central management of applications

**WebApp (Namespaced):**
```yaml
apiVersion: apiextensions.crossplane.io/v2
kind: CompositeResourceDefinition
metadata:
  name: webapps.example.crossplane.io
spec:
  scope: Namespaced
  group: example.crossplane.io
  names:
    kind: WebApp
    plural: webapps
```

A more advanced abstraction for web applications that includes:
- **Scaling configuration**: autoscaling with min/max replicas
- **FQDN**: domain name for the application
- **Port**: exposed port for the service
- **Image**: container image to deploy

This creates a complete web application stack including:
- Deployment with HPA (Horizontal Pod Autoscaler)
- Service
- Ingress with the specified FQDN

#### 5. Compositions (`05-compositions/`)

Compositions define how to implement the XRDs using managed resources. Each XRD has one or more compositions that translate the high-level API into concrete Kubernetes resources using the provider-kubernetes.

For example, a WebApp composition might create:
- A Kubernetes Deployment
- A Kubernetes Service  
- A Kubernetes Ingress
- A HorizontalPodAutoscaler (if scaling is enabled)

#### 6. Examples (`06-examples/`)

Sample claims demonstrating how developers use the platform APIs:

**Basic App Example:**
```yaml
apiVersion: example.crossplane.io/v1
kind: App
metadata:
  namespace: default
  name: my-app
  annotations:
    terasky.backstage.io/links: |
      [
        {
          "url": "https://docs.upbound.io/",
          "title": "Upbound Docs",
          "icon": "dashboard"
        }
      ]
spec:
  image: nginx
```

**WebApp Example:**
```yaml
apiVersion: example.crossplane.io/v1
kind: WebApp
metadata:
  namespace: default
  name: my-web-app
spec:
  image: nginx
  scaling:
    enabled: true
    minReplicas: 2
    maxReplicas: 4
  fqdn: webapp.example.com
  port: 80
```

### Integration with Backstage

The Crossplane resources integrate with Backstage through:

1. **Automatic Ingestion**: The Kubernetes Ingestor plugin discovers Crossplane Claims and XRDs
2. **Template Generation**: XRDs are automatically converted to Backstage Software Templates
3. **Resource Visualization**: The Crossplane plugin displays claim status and managed resources
4. **Self-Service**: Developers can provision infrastructure through Backstage's UI

### Viewing Crossplane Resources

Check installed providers:
```bash
kubectl get providers
```

View XRDs:
```bash
kubectl get xrds
```

List all claims:
```bash
kubectl get apps,clusterapps,webapps -A
```

View composition revisions:
```bash
kubectl get compositionrevisions
```
</details>
<details>
  <summary>Kyverno</summary>

Kyverno is configured in the demo environment to enforce policies on platform resources. The policies are designed to work with the Crossplane XRDs and validate that resources meet organizational standards.

### Deployed Policies

#### 1. Require Autoscaling for WebApps

**Policy Name:** `require-autoscaling`  
**File:** `kyverno/require-autoscaling-webapps.yaml`

```yaml
apiVersion: kyverno.io/v1
kind: ClusterPolicy
metadata:
  annotations:
    policies.kyverno.io/category: Resources
    policies.kyverno.io/severity: high
  name: require-autoscaling
spec:
  admission: true
  background: true
  validationFailureAction: Audit
  rules:
  - match:
      any:
      - resources:
          kinds:
          - WebApp
    name: validate-autoscaling-enabled
    validate:
      pattern:
        spec:
          scaling:
            enabled: true
      message: autoscaling enablement is required in this environment for webapps
```

**Purpose:**
- Ensures all WebApp claims have autoscaling enabled
- Prevents deployment of non-scalable web applications
- Category: Resources | Severity: High

**Action:** Audit mode (reports violations but allows creation)

**Example Violation:**
```yaml
spec:
  scaling:
    enabled: false  # This would trigger a policy violation
```

#### 2. Unique Ingress Host

**Policy Name:** `unique-ingress-host`  
**File:** `kyverno/unique-ingress-host.yaml`

```yaml
apiVersion: kyverno.io/v1
kind: ClusterPolicy
metadata:
  name: unique-ingress-host
  annotations:
    policies.kyverno.io/category: Sample
    policies.kyverno.io/severity: medium
spec:
  validationFailureAction: Audit
  background: false
  rules:
  - name: check-single-host-create
    match:
      any:
      - resources:
          kinds:
          - WebApp
    context:
      - name: hosts
        apiCall:
          urlPath: "/apis/networking.k8s.io/v1/ingresses"
          jmesPath: "items[].spec.rules[].host"
    validate:
      message: "The Webapp FQDN must be unique."
      deny:
        conditions:
          all:
            - key: "{{ request.object.spec.fqdn }}"
              operator: AnyIn
              value: "{{ hosts }}"
```

**Purpose:**
- Prevents FQDN conflicts across WebApp resources
- Queries existing Ingresses via API call to check for duplicates
- Validates both CREATE and UPDATE operations
- Category: Sample | Severity: Medium

**How it Works:**
1. When a WebApp is created/updated, the policy queries all existing Ingress resources
2. Extracts all hostnames from existing Ingresses
3. Checks if the WebApp's FQDN is already in use
4. Denies the request if the FQDN is not unique

**Example Violation:**
```yaml
spec:
  fqdn: webapp.example.com  # Fails if this hostname is already used by another Ingress
```

#### 3. Deny NGINX Image

**Policy Name:** `deny-nginx-image`  
**File:** `kyverno/nginx-not-allowed-policy.yaml`

```yaml
apiVersion: kyverno.io/v1
kind: ClusterPolicy
metadata:
  annotations:
    policies.kyverno.io/category: Data
    policies.kyverno.io/severity: medium
  name: deny-nginx-image
spec:
  admission: true
  background: true
  validationFailureAction: Audit
  rules:
  - match:
      any:
      - resources:
          kinds:
          - App
          - ClusterApp
          - WebApp
    name: test-image
    validate:
      pattern:
        spec:
          image: "!nginx"
      message: nginx image not allowed
```

**Purpose:**
- Demonstrates image policy enforcement
- Prevents use of the `nginx` image across all application types
- Applies to App, ClusterApp, and WebApp kinds
- Category: Data | Severity: Medium

**Use Case:** Replace with organization-specific image policies such as:
- Requiring images from approved registries
- Enforcing image scanning requirements
- Mandating specific image tags (no `latest`)

**Example Violation:**
```yaml
spec:
  image: nginx  # This would trigger a policy violation
```

#### 4. Policy RBAC

**File:** `kyverno/policy-rbac.yaml`

```yaml
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: ClusterRole
metadata:
  name: kyverno:crontab:view
  labels:
    rbac.kyverno.io/aggregate-to-background-controller: "true"
    rbac.kyverno.io/aggregate-to-reports-controller: "true"
rules:
- apiGroups:
  - '*'
  resources:
  - '*'
  verbs:
  - get
  - list
  - watch
```

**Purpose:**
- Grants Kyverno's background and reports controllers read access to all resources
- Required for background scanning and policy report generation
- Enables Kyverno to validate existing resources, not just admission requests

### Policy Enforcement Mode

All policies are currently set to **Audit** mode (`validationFailureAction: Audit`), which means:
- ✅ Resources are allowed to be created even if they violate policies
- 📊 Policy violations are recorded in PolicyReports
- 🔍 Violations are visible in Backstage through the Kyverno plugin

**To enforce policies** (block violating resources), change:
```yaml
validationFailureAction: Enforce
```

### Integration with Backstage

The Kyverno policies integrate with Backstage through:

1. **Policy Reports**: The Kyverno plugin displays policy violations on entity pages
2. **Compliance Visibility**: Developers see which resources violate policies
3. **Remediation Guidance**: Policy messages provide clear guidance on how to fix violations

### Viewing Policy Reports

Check all policies:
```bash
kubectl get clusterpolicies
```

View policy reports:
```bash
kubectl get policyreports -A
```

Check violations for a specific namespace:
```bash
kubectl get policyreport -n default -o yaml
```

View cluster-wide policy report:
```bash
kubectl get clusterpolicyreport -o yaml
```

### Best Practices Demonstrated

1. **Progressive Enforcement**: Start with Audit mode, analyze violations, then enforce
2. **Clear Messages**: Policy violation messages explain what's wrong and how to fix it
3. **Layered Validation**: Multiple policies working together (scaling, uniqueness, image)
4. **Platform Integration**: Policies that understand platform abstractions (XRDs)
5. **API-Aware**: Policies that query cluster state to make informed decisions

# Workshop Persona Scenarios
<details>
  <summary>Developer Exerience - End to End Flow</summary>

## End to end flow - User Perspective

Let's go through what a day in the life of a developer looks like in the BACKStack ecosystem. This walkthrough demonstrates how developers interact with the platform to discover existing applications, create new ones, and remediate policy violations.

### Step 1: Logging into Backstage

When you first access Backstage, you'll see the login screen where you can authenticate using GitHub or continue as a guest user.

![Login Screen](../images/dev-flow/01-login-screen.png)

For this demo, we'll use **GitHub** login. In a production environment, you can use GitHub Auth or your organization's SSO provider like Okta, EntraID etc.

### Step 2: Exploring the Catalog

After logging in, you're presented with the **Software Catalog** - the central hub showing all components, systems, APIs, and resources in your organization.

![Catalog Overview](../images/dev-flow/02-catalog-overview.png)

The catalog displays:
- **Components**: Applications and services
- **Systems**: Groupings of related components
- **Resources**: Infrastructure resources (databases, message queues, etc.)
- **APIs**: Service interfaces
- **Templates**: Software templates for creating new projects

You can filter by type, owner, tags, and other metadata to quickly find what you're looking for.

### Step 3: Viewing an Existing Application

Let's click on an existing application to see its details. Select **my-app** from the catalog.

![App Overview](../images/dev-flow/03-my-app-overview.png)

The application overview page shows:
- **About**: Description, owner, system, and metadata
- **Links**: Quick access to related resources
- **Relations**: Dependencies and relationships to other entities
- **Tags**: Categorization and searchability

#### Identifying Policy Violations

Notice the warning indicator on the page - this app has Kyverno policy violations. You can see a quick glance at the error:

![Kyverno Error Quick Glance](../images/dev-flow/04-my-app-kyverno-error-quick-glance.png)

#### Viewing Policy Details

Click on the **Kyverno** tab to see detailed policy reports:

![Kyverno Error Dedicated Tab](../images/dev-flow/05-my-app-kyverno-error-dedicated-tab.png)

The Kyverno tab shows:
- **Policy name**: Which policy was violated
- **Severity**: High, Medium, or Low
- **Status**: Pass or Fail
- **Message**: Why the policy failed

For more details, click on the policy to open the **Policy Viewer**:

![Kyverno Error Policy Viewer](../images/dev-flow/06-my-app-kyverno-error-policy-viewer.png)

This shows:
- The complete policy definition
- Specific rules that failed
- Remediation guidance

In this case, the policy `deny-nginx-image` is failing because the app is using the `nginx` image, which is not allowed in this environment.

#### Viewing Crossplane Resources

Switch to the **Crossplane** tab to see the infrastructure resources provisioned for this application:

![Crossplane Resources View](../images/dev-flow/07-my-app-crossplane-resources-view.png)

This view shows:
- **Claim Status**: Whether the Crossplane claim is ready
- **Managed Resources**: All Kubernetes resources created by Crossplane
- **Sync Status**: Whether resources are in sync with the desired state

You can click on any resource to see its YAML definition:

![Crossplane Resources YAML](../images/dev-flow/08-my-app-crossplane-resources-view-yaml.png)

Or view its events to troubleshoot issues:

![Crossplane Resources Events](../images/dev-flow/09-my-app-crossplane-resources-view-events.png)

The **Graph View** provides a visual representation of resource relationships:

![Crossplane Resources Graph View](../images/dev-flow/10-my-app-crossplane-resources-graph-view.png)

This helps you understand how your high-level claim translates into actual Kubernetes resources (Deployments, Services, etc.).

### Step 4: Creating a New Application

Now let's create a new application using the Software Templates feature. Click on **Create** in the sidebar.

![Scaffolder](../images/dev-flow/11-scaffolder.png)

You'll see all available templates. These templates are generated automatically from Crossplane XRDs, ensuring that developers can automatically create resources that the platform supports.

#### Choosing a Template

Select the **App** template to create a new basic application.

#### Step 4.1: Application Metadata

First, provide basic metadata about your application:

![Create New App Metadata](../images/dev-flow/12-create-new-app-metadata.png)

Fields typically include:
- **Name**: Application name (must be Kubernetes-compatible)
- **Namespace**: Where to deploy the app
- **Owner**: Which team owns it

In this demo we will call the component **demo-app-01** and put it in the namespace **backstack-demo**.

#### Step 4.2: Application Specification

Next, configure the application-specific settings:

![Create New App Spec](../images/dev-flow/13-create-new-app-spec.png)

For a basic App, you'll specify:
- **Image**: Container image to deploy (e.g., `nginx`)
- Other app-specific parameters defined in the XRD

In this demo we will use the image **nginx**


#### Step 4.3: Crossplane Settings

Configure Crossplane-specific options:

![Create New App Crossplane Settings](../images/dev-flow/14-create-new-app-crossplane-settings.png)

This includes:
- **Composition Selection**: Which implementation to use

You can choose from available compositions:

![Composition Selector](../images/dev-flow/15-create-new-app-crossplane-settings-composition-selector.png)

Different compositions might offer:
- Different cloud providers (AWS, GCP, Azure)
- Different performance tiers (basic, standard, premium)
- Different architectural patterns (serverless, containerized, etc.)

In this demo we will use **app-pythonic** as the composition.


#### Step 4.4: GitOps Settings

Configure where and how to store the application manifest:

![GitOps Settings](../images/dev-flow/16-gitops-settings.png)

Settings include:
- **Push Manifest To GitOps Repository** - Enabled by default
- **Manifest Layout** - The strategy by which to place the manifest in the GitOps Repo
- **Target Clusters** - Which Clusters known to backstage we want to deploy or manifest to

In this demo we will use the **cluster-scoped** manifest layout and as we only have 1 cluster attached to backstage, we will select **demo-cluster**.

#### Step 4.5: Review Your Choices

Before creating the application, review all your selections:

![Review Choices](../images/dev-flow/17-new-app-review-choices.png)

This gives you a chance to:
- Verify all parameters are correct
- Go back to edit any section
- Understand what will be created

#### Step 4.6: Execution Summary

Click **Create** to execute the template. You'll see a real-time execution log:

![Execution Summary](../images/dev-flow/18-new-app-execution-summary.png)

The scaffolder will:
1. ✅ Generate the Crossplane claim YAML
2. ✅ Create a Git branch
3. ✅ Commit the manifest to the repository
4. ✅ Create a Pull Request

### Step 5: GitOps Workflow

After the scaffolder completes, a Pull Request is automatically created in your repository.

#### Viewing the Pull Request

Navigate to GitHub to review the PR:

![PR Summary](../images/dev-flow/19-pr-summary.png)

The PR includes:
- **Title**: Descriptive name of the change
- **Description**: Details about what's being added
- **Labels**: Automated tags for classification
- **Checks**: CI/CD validations (linting, security scans, etc.)

#### Reviewing Changed Files

Click on **Files Changed** to see what will be added:

![PR Files Changed](../images/dev-flow/20-pr-files-changed.png)

This shows:
- The exact YAML manifest that will be deployed
- The directory structure (following ArgoCD ApplicationSet pattern)

Example structure:
```
demo-cluster/
  └── default/
      └── App/
          └── my-new-app.yaml
```

#### Merging the Pull Request

After review and approval (if required), merge the PR:

![PR Merged](../images/dev-flow/21-pr-merged.png)

### Step 6: Automated Resource Creation

Once the PR is merged, the GitOps workflow automatically kicks in:

#### ArgoCD Detects the Change

ArgoCD's ApplicationSet detects the new file and creates an Application:

![App Auto Created](../images/dev-flow/22-app-auto-created.png)

You can verify this with:
```bash
kubectl get applications -n argocd
```

#### Crossplane Provisions Resources

The Crossplane composite is applied to the cluster, and Crossplane begins provisioning resources:

![Crossplane App Auto Created](../images/dev-flow/23-crossplane-app-auto-created.png)

You can check the composite status with:
```bash
kubectl get apps -n backstack-demo
```

#### Backstage Discovers the Application

The Kubernetes Ingestor plugin automatically discovers the new Crossplane composite and creates a Backstage catalog entity:

![App Auto Ingested](../images/dev-flow/24-app-auto-ingested.png)

Within seconds (configured as 10-second polling), your new application appears in the Backstage catalog with:
- Full metadata from the Crossplane composite
- Annotations and labels
- Relationships to other resources
- Integration with Kyverno and Crossplane plugins

### Step 7: Addressing Policy Violations

When you view the newly created app in Backstage, you might see policy violations:

![App Kyverno Details](../images/dev-flow/25-app-kyverno-details.png)

In this example:
- ❌ **deny-nginx-image**: The app is using the nginx image (not allowed)
- ❌ **require-autoscaling** (if it's a WebApp): Autoscaling is not enabled

Let's fix these violations using the **GitOps Manifest Updater** plugin.

### Step 8: Updating the Application Manifest

In this environment we have added a backstage plugin which provides a **GitOps Manifest Updater** feature that lets you modify manifests without manually editing YAML files.

#### Access the Entity Scaffolder

Go to the **Scaffolder Content** tab on the entity page:

![Entity Scaffolder](../images/dev-flow/26-entity-scaffolder.png)

This shows templates that are contextual to the current entity. Click on the **Update Kubernetes Manifest** template.

#### Select the Entity to Update

If prompted, confirm which entity you want to update:

![Update Manifest Entity Selection](../images/dev-flow/27-update-manifest-entity-selection.png)

#### Authenticate with GitHub

You'll need to authenticate with GitHub to update the manifest:

![GitHub Login](../images/dev-flow/28-github-login.png)

This uses OAuth to grant Backstage temporary access to your repositories.

#### Fill Out the Update Form

The GitOps Manifest Updater dynamically generates a form based on the Crossplane XRD's OpenAPI schema, and the current state stored in your GitOps repository:

![Update Form](../images/dev-flow/29-update-form.png)

You can for example:
- Change the container image from `nginx` to a compliant image

The form includes:
- **Type validation**: Ensures values match the schema
- **Required field indicators**: Shows what must be filled
- **Default values**: Pre-populated with current settings
- **Descriptions**: Help text from the XRD schema

In this demo we will change the image to **nginx:stable-alpine3.21-slim**


#### Review Your Changes

Before submitting, review what will be changed:

![Update Review](../images/dev-flow/30-update-review.png)

This shows:
- A diff of the changes
- Which fields are being modified

#### Execution Summary

Submit the update to create a PR:

![Update Summary](../images/dev-flow/31-update-summary.png)

The workflow:
1. ✅ Clones the repository
2. ✅ Creates a new branch
3. ✅ Updates the manifest YAML
4. ✅ Commits the changes
5. ✅ Creates a Pull Request

### Step 9: Merging the Update

Navigate to GitHub to review the update PR:

![PR Files Changed](../images/dev-flow/32-pr-files-changed.png)

After review, merge the PR. ArgoCD will detect the change and sync it to the cluster.

#### Manual Sync (Optional)

If you don't want to wait for the automatic sync interval, you can manually trigger a sync:

```bash
kubectl patch app backstack-demo-app-app -n argocd \
  --type merge \
  -p '{"operation":{"initiatedBy":{"username":"admin"},"sync":{"syncStrategy":{"hook":{"force":true}}}}}'
```

![Manually Sync App](../images/dev-flow/33-manually-sync-app-kubectl.png)

This can also be done via the ArgoCD CLI or UI (The UI does not work in web based codespaces) which can be setup using the [following guide](../../ARGOCD.md)

### Step 10: Verifying Policy Compliance

After ArgoCD syncs the updated manifest, Crossplane updates the running application. Kyverno automatically re-evaluates the policies.

Return to Backstage and refresh the entity page:

![Policy Now Passes](../images/dev-flow/34-policy-now-passes.png)

✅ **Success!** The policy violations are resolved:
- ✅ **deny-nginx-image**: Now using a non blocked image

The entity page now shows:
- All policies passing (green indicators)
- No warnings or errors
- Full compliance with organizational standards

### Summary: Developer Experience

This end-to-end flow demonstrates the complete developer experience in the BACKStack platform:

#### 🔍 **Discovery**

<details>
<summary>End to End Flow - Platform Engineer</summary>

## End to end flow - Platform Engineer Perspective
Now lets look at the Platform Engineers experience working on a platform based on the BACKStack.

The scenario we will be implementing in this workshop is:
1. Adding a new service offering to our end users
2. Updating a service offering already being used
3. Letting users know they need to make some changes and guiding them through the platform

### New Service Offering Workflow
In this demo we are going to create a new Crossplane XRD and Composition to support creating PostgreSQL clusters in our environments using the Cloud Native PostgreSQL operator

#### Deploying the CNPG Operator
The first step we must take is to install the operator

```bash
helm repo add cnpg https://cloudnative-pg.github.io/charts
helm upgrade --install cnpg \
  --namespace cnpg-system \
  --create-namespace \
  cnpg/cloudnative-pg \
  --wait
```

#### Defining Our New Service
Now that we have our operator installed we can create an XRD for our new service offering

```bash
mkdir crossplane/04-xrds/dbaas
touch crossplane/04-xrds/dbaas/xrd.yaml
```

We can now start by adding the initial Metadata and general configurations to the [new file](../../crossplane/04-xrds/dbaas/xrd.yaml)

```yaml
apiVersion: apiextensions.crossplane.io/v2
kind: CompositeResourceDefinition
metadata:
  name: databases.demo.kubecon2025na.io
spec:
  scope: Namespaced
  group: demo.kubecon2025na.io
  names:
    kind: Database
    plural: databases
```

As we can see we are defining a new **namespace scoped** XRD with the kind **Database** in the **demo.kubecon2025na.io** API Group.

Now we need to add the schema of our API we want our users to use

```yaml
  versions:
  - name: v1
    served: true
    referenceable: true
    schema:
     openAPIV3Schema:
        properties:
          spec:
            description: The OpenAPIV3Schema of this Composite Resource Definition.
            properties:
              storageGB:
                default: 1
                description: The desired storage capacity of the database, in Gigabytes.
                enum:
                - 1
                - 2
                - 5
                type: integer
              version:
                default: 17.1
                description: The desired version of the database.
                enum:
                - 17.1
                - 17.2
                type: number
              highAvailability:
                default: false
                description: Enable high availability.
                type: boolean
            type: object
        type: object
```

This API allows our users to only change specific elements of the cluster configuration that we have decided to allow them to configure:
- **Disk Size**
- **PostgreSQL Version**
- **High Availability**

Now let's implement the Composition:

```bash
mkdir crossplane/05-compositions/dbaas
touch crossplane/05-compositions/dbaas/cnpg-go-templating.yaml
```

We will first add the basic information in our [new file](../../crossplane/05-compositions/dbaas/cnpg-go-templating.yaml)
  
```yaml
apiVersion: apiextensions.crossplane.io/v1
kind: Composition
metadata:
  name: cnpg-demo
spec:
  compositeTypeRef:
    apiVersion: demo.kubecon2025na.io/v1
    kind: Database
  mode: Pipeline
```

Here we have defined that this composition will be called **cnpg-demo** and will be an implementation for the XRD we defined above. 

The next step is to implement the Composition pipeline logic. In this example we will use the **go-templating** function.

```yaml
  pipeline:
  - step: create-db
    functionRef:
      name: crossplane-contrib-function-go-templating
    input:
      apiVersion: gotemplating.fn.crossplane.io/v1beta1
      kind: GoTemplate
      source: Inline
      inline:
        template: |
          ---
          apiVersion: postgresql.cnpg.io/v1
          kind: Cluster
          metadata:
            name: {{ index .observed.composite.resource.metadata.name }}
            annotations:
              {{ setResourceNameAnnotation "database" }}
              {{ if eq (.observed.resources.database | getResourceCondition "Ready").Status "True" }}
              gotemplating.fn.crossplane.io/ready: "True"
              {{ end }}
          spec:
            {{- if .observed.composite.resource.spec.highAvailability }}
            instances: 3
            {{- else }}
            instances: 1
            {{- end }}
            imageName: ghcr.io/cloudnative-pg/postgresql:{{ .observed.composite.resource.spec.version }}
            storage:
              size: {{ .observed.composite.resource.spec.storageGB }}Gi
```

Now that we have our base XRD and Compositions created we need to apply them to the cluster:

```bash
kubectl apply -f crossplane/04-xrds/dbaas/xrd.yaml
kubectl apply -f crossplane/05-compositions/dbaas/cnpg-go-templating.yaml
```

One final thing we need to do, because we are not using a crossplane provider resource rather a CNPG Operator based resource, we need to give Crossplane permissions to manage these resources for us:

```bash
cat <<EOF | kubectl apply -f-
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: ClusterRole
metadata:
  name: cnpg:aggregate-to-crossplane
  labels:
    rbac.crossplane.io/aggregate-to-crossplane: "true"
rules:
- apiGroups:
  - postgresql.cnpg.io
  resources:
  - clusters
  verbs:
  - "*"
EOF
```

Now we can go to Backstage and we should see within a few seconds, the new Template available in our platform!

#### Creating A DB instance
Lets now look at this for a moment from the developers perspective of consuming the service.

We first will navigate to Backstage and click on **Create** in the sidebar, and then select the Database template.

![Scaffolder](../images/pe-flow/01-new-service-available.png)


##### Database Metadata

First, provide basic metadata about your application:

![Create New App Metadata](../images/pe-flow/02-metadata.png)

Fields typically include:
- **Name**: Database name (must be Kubernetes-compatible)
- **Namespace**: Where to deploy the app
- **Owner**: Which team owns it

In this demo we will call the component **db-test-01** and put it in the namespace **backstack-demo**.

##### Database Spec

Next, configure the database-specific settings:

![Create New DB Spec](../images/pe-flow/03-spec.png)

As we can see, the fields we have defined in our XRD including field types, enums, etc. are exposed here via the form.

In this demo we will use the storage size of **1**, we will **not** enable high availability, and we will choose **17.1** as the PostgreSQL version.


##### Crossplane Settings

Configure Crossplane-specific options:

![Create New DB Crossplane Settings](../images/pe-flow/04-crossplane.png)

##### GitOps Settings

Configure where and how to store the DB manifest:

![GitOps Settings](../images/pe-flow/05-gitops.png)

Settings include:
- **Push Manifest To GitOps Repository** - Enabled by default
- **Manifest Layout** - The strategy by which to place the manifest in the GitOps Repo
- **Target Clusters** - Which Clusters known to backstage we want to deploy or manifest to

In this demo we will use the **cluster-scoped** manifest layout and as we only have 1 cluster attached to backstage, we will select **demo-cluster**.

##### Review Your Choices

Before creating the db, review all your selections:

![Review Choices](../images/pe-flow/06-summary.png)

This gives you a chance to:
- Verify all parameters are correct
- Go back to edit any section
- Understand what will be created

##### Execution Summary

Click **Create** to execute the template. You'll see a real-time execution log:

![Execution Summary](../images/pe-flow/07-created.png)

The scaffolder will:
1. ✅ Generate the Crossplane composite YAML
2. ✅ Create a Git branch
3. ✅ Commit the manifest to the repository
4. ✅ Create a Pull Request

##### GitOps Workflow

After the scaffolder completes, a Pull Request is automatically created in your repository.

##### Viewing the Pull Request

Navigate to GitHub to review the PR.

The PR includes:
- **Title**: Descriptive name of the change
- **Description**: Details about what's being added
- **Labels**: Automated tags for classification
- **Checks**: CI/CD validations (linting, security scans, etc.)

##### Reviewing Changed Files

Click on **Files Changed** to see what will be added:

![PR Files Changed](../images/pe-flow/08-pr.png)

This shows:
- The exact YAML manifest that will be deployed
- The directory structure (following ArgoCD ApplicationSet pattern)

Example structure:
```
demo-cluster/
  └── default/
      └── Database/
          └── my-db.yaml
```

##### Merging the Pull Request

After review and approval (if required), merge the PR.

#### Automated Resource Creation
Once the PR is merged, the GitOps workflow automatically kicks in:

##### ArgoCD Detects the Change

ArgoCD's ApplicationSet detects the new file and creates an Application:

![DB Auto Created](../images/pe-flow/09-app-auto-created.png)

You can verify this with:
```bash
kubectl get applications -n argocd
```

#### Crossplane Provisions Resources

The Crossplane composite is applied to the cluster, and Crossplane begins provisioning resources:

![Crossplane DB Auto Created](../images/pe-flow/10-db-created.png)

You can check the composite status with:
```bash
kubectl get database -n backstack-demo
```

#### Backstage Discovers the Application

The Kubernetes Ingestor plugin automatically discovers the new Crossplane composite and creates a Backstage catalog entity:

![App Auto Ingested](../images/pe-flow/11-db-ingested.png)

Within seconds (configured as 10-second polling), your new DB appears in the Backstage catalog with:
- Full metadata from the Crossplane composite
- Annotations and labels
- Relationships to other resources
- Integration with Kyverno and Crossplane plugins


### Updating A Service Offering Workflow
Now that we have out Database offering in the platform and it is being consumed by our platform users, we need to handle Day-2 changes.

We have already seen in the Developer workflow how we can allow users to update an existing resource. but lets now see how we can evolve our APIs over time.

In this example we will be adding a new version for PostgreSQL, and we also want to deprecate the older versions.

#### Updating the supported versions
We can open the [XRD manifest](../../crossplane/04-xrds/dbaas/xrd.yaml) and change the enum values to include our new supported versions and also change the default version

In this example we will change the default version to **17.4** and also add **17.4** to the enum values
![XRD Changes](../images/pe-flow/12-xrd-change.png)

With the changes made in the manifest we can now apply this to our cluster
```bash
kubectl apply -f crossplane/04-xrds/dbaas/xrd.yaml
```

Now that the change has been applied to the cluster, we can go back to the Create tab in Backstage, and when we try to create a new Database instance, we can see that 17.3 is an option.

#### Deprecating Old Versions
One of the common cases which is relevant for our demo, is deprecation of old DB versions, and needing users to upgrade to later versions.

Let's see how we can implement this in a simple and elegant manner using the BACKStack ecosystem.

For this we will utilize a Kyverno policy which we can create, which can be used to provide feedback to our end users.

Let's start by creating a new file for our policy:
```bash
touch kyverno/deprecate-old-psql-versions.yaml
```
Now we can start to implement the policy itself:

```yaml
apiVersion: kyverno.io/v1
kind: ClusterPolicy
metadata:
  annotations:
    policies.kyverno.io/category: Data
    policies.kyverno.io/severity: medium
    policies.kyverno.io/scored: "false"
  name: postgres-deprecations
spec:
  admission: true
  background: true
  validationFailureAction: Audit
```

Now that we have built the base of the policy, we need to add our relevant rules to deprecate the older versions which in this case are **17.1** and **17.2**.

Let's add these rules:
```yaml
  rules:
  - name: psql-17-1-deprecation
    match:
      any:
      - resources:
          kinds:
          - Database
    skipBackgroundRequests: true
    validate:
      message: version 17.1 is deprecated and will be removed on JAnuary 1st, 2026
      deny:
        conditions:
          all:
            - key: "{{ request.object.spec.version }}"
              operator: Equals
              value: 17.1
  - name: psql-17-2-deprecation
    match:
      any:
      - resources:
          kinds:
          - Database
    skipBackgroundRequests: true
    validate:
      message: version 17.2 is deprecated and will be removed on May 1st, 2026
      deny:
        conditions:
          all:
            - key: "{{ request.object.spec.version }}"
              operator: LessThanOrEquals
              value: 17.2
```

Now that we have our policy defined let's apply it to our cluster:

```bash
kubectl apply -f kyverno/deprecate-old-psql-versions.yaml
```

With this policy now applied to our cluster, we can go back to the Backstage UI and go to the software catalog and find our old Database instance to see what the UX from the Users perspective will be:

![Warning Of Deprecation](../images/pe-flow/14-policy-deprecation.png)

Now the user can see exactly what the issue is, and he can now when ready apply the update using the Scaffolder Content Tab:

![Entity Scaffolder](../images/pe-flow/15-entity-updater.png)

We can now select the **Update Kubernetes Manifest** Template:

![Update Template](../images/pe-flow/16-select-entity.png)

And with our entity pre-selected, we can now see the current state in the form:

![Current State](../images/pe-flow/17-current-settings.png)

And we can see that the new version is available in the dropdown and can be selected:

![New Version](../images/pe-flow/18-new-version-available.png)

Once we select the new version, we can review the changes:

![Review](../images/pe-flow/19-review.png)

And then when we are happy with the changes, we can run the template by clicking Create:

![Submit](../images/pe-flow/20-created.png)

We can then navigate to the GitOps repo, and we can approve the PR after checking the changed files:

![PR](../images/pe-flow/21-pr.png)

And finally to save time and not wait for reconciliation of ArgoCD we can manually trigger the sync of the application managing this Database resource

```bash
kubectl patch app backstack-demo-database-database -n argocd \
  --type merge \
  -p '{"operation":{"initiatedBy":{"username":"admin"},"sync":{"syncStrategy":{"hook":{"force":true}}}}}'
```

We can see that from the Kubernetes side the Database resource gets updated right away within a few seconds:

```bash
kubectl get database -n backstack-demo db-test-01 -o jsonpath='{.spec.version}'
```

And if we go back to the UI now in Backstage we can see that the Resource is updated in the UI and after about a minute the policy reevaluates, and the results now show 2 passing rules:

# Bringing AI Into The Mix
<details>
<summary>AI in the BACKStack</summary>
## AI Plugins In Backstage
One of the ways to integrate AI into our environment is by adding plugins into our Backstage instance.

There are multiple options already available in the community for this:
- [**Agent Forge**](https://github.com/backstage/community-plugins/tree/main/workspaces/agent-forge/plugins/agent-forge) - A Backstage plugin which integrates with the CNOE project called CAIPE (Commnity AI Platform Engineering) to provide specialized chatbots with specified Agents for different elements in the stack directly into the Backstage UI.
- [**MCP Chat**](https://github.com/backstage/community-plugins/tree/main/workspaces/mcp-chat/plugins/mcp-chat) - A Backstage set of plugins providing a powerful MCP based chatbot directly in the Backstage UI
- [**Copilot**](https://github.com/backstage/community-plugins/tree/main/workspaces/copilot/plugins/copilot) - A Backsytage set of plugins giving visibility and insights into GitHub Copilot usage within you companies GitHub organization
- [**AWS Labs GenAI**](https://github.com/awslabs/backstage-plugins-for-aws/blob/main/plugins/genai/README.md) - A set of backstage plugins which provide a Chatbot interface in Backstage which can leverage the roader Backstage plugin ecosystem, by exposing different plugins endpoints as tools to the AI Agent.

Each of these approaches are about bringing AI interfaces into Backstage, and each has a unique and powerful set of capabilities worth evaluating.

Let's see another approach which is actually part of Backstage itself.

## Backstage As An MCP Server
Backstage has a new capability allowing us to turn Backstage into a remote MCP server, supporting both SSE and Streamable HTTP protocols. This capability also supports the MCP OAuth specification, supporting dynamic client registration. This allows us to expose backstage plugin capabilities as MCP tools in an aggregated MCP server provided by backstage, and for the same auth and RBAC which is configured in Backstage the portal to also be enforced in our MCP interface to Backstage!

In this demo environment we have included a few plugins which implement the new MCP tool capabilities which we can test in this environment.

<summary>Summary Of The Workshop</summary>

## 🔧 **Technical Patterns Demonstrated**

### **1. Abstraction Layer Design**
```
User Intent (XRD) → Platform Logic (Composition) → Infrastructure (Resources)
```
- High-level APIs hide complexity
- Multiple compositions can implement same XRD
- Users choose implementation via composition selector

### **2. Schema-Driven Development**
- OpenAPI v3 schemas define APIs
- Automatic form generation from schemas
- Type validation and constraint enforcement
- Documentation embedded in schema

### **3. Policy as Code**
- Kyverno policies for governance
- Audit mode for non-blocking warnings
- Context-aware policies (API calls, variables)
- Version-specific rules and deprecations

### **4. GitOps Everything**
- Platform definitions in Git (XRDs, Compositions)
- User resources in Git (Claims)
- Policy definitions in Git (Kyverno)
- Change tracking and rollback capabilities

### **5. Event-Driven Automation**
- ArgoCD detects Git changes automatically
- Crossplane reconciles desired state
- Backstage ingests resources dynamically
- Kyverno evaluates policies continuously

## Key Takeaways

1. **Platform Engineering is Product Management**: Treat the platform as a product with users, features, and roadmap
2. **APIs are Contracts**: Well-designed abstractions reduce cognitive load and enable self-service
3. **Policies are Communication**: Use governance to guide, not just block
4. **Automation Reduces Toil**: GitOps and automatic discovery eliminate manual processes
5. **Evolution Over Revolution**: Incremental improvements with backward compatibility
6. **Developer Experience Matters**: Easy consumption drives platform adoption

## 🔮 **What's Next?**

After establishing the BACKStack foundation, platform engineers can:
- Add more providers
- Create higher-level abstractions (full application stacks)
- Implement cost tracking and quotas
- Add advanced networking and security policies
- Enable multi-cluster and multi-tenant deployments
